# Raised to the Power 
## A review of finance.vote's usage of quadratic voting mechanism for predicting crypto markets.


## Project Intro/Objective


## What is Quadratic Voting
Quadratic Voting is a method of collective decision-making in which a participant votes not just for or against an issue, but also expresses how strongly they feel about it. It can help protect the interests of small groups of voters that care deeply about particular issues. 

In Quadratic Voting, each participant is given a number of credits that can be used to vote for an issue. However, the cost of casting more than one vote for an issue is quadratic, not linear. So, the marginal cost of each additional vote is far higher than of the previous vote.

## How does markets.vote work
Users are incentives to make market predictions in a series of tournaments focussed on a basket of crypto assets. 

Quadratic voting is used to generate a consensus in a perceived future market order. Users then spend a budget of vote power to create a new order, based on their perception of token quality and future potential market performance.Users are rewarded with a proportional share of a network generated reward pool depending on the proportionality of their correctness. Users can amplify their vote power beyond the starting level by demonstrating a history of correct decision making in the markets, or by purchasing more identities.
